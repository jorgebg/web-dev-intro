    introduction: |
      CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. It is what you use to selectively style HTML elements.
      For example, the following code targets the `p` tags (*paragraph* text), setting their font color to `white` and the background color to `black`:

      ```css
      p {
        color: white;
        background-color: black;
      }
      ```

      This will change the color of the background and font of **all the paragraphs** in the document (all the `p` elements).

      The CSS code must be inside a `<style>` tag in the HTML document:

      ```html
      <html>
        <head>
          <style>
            p {
              color: white;
              background-color: black;
            }
          </style>
        </head>
      ...
      ```


      It's recommended to place the `style` tag inside the `head` tag, so the styles are loaded before the body is rendered.

    steps: |
      1. Use CSS for changing the background color and a font color of the `body` element. You can pick any of the available [named colors](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp). They must be different from the given example.
    challenge: |
      Replace the named colors with [hexadecimal colors](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hexadecimal.asp).
    rubric:
      Background color: 2
      Font color: 2

  - name: Styling text
    introduction: |
      In the previous activity, we have styled all elements based on their HTML tag names (`p` and `body`).

      To select a subset of the elements without changing the others, you can add a `class` attribute to the tags and then target that class in your CSS.
      Elements with the `class` attribute can be targeted in CSS using a selector following the format `.class { ... }`. For example:

      ```html
      <style>
        .special {
          font-weight: bold;
        }
      </style>
      ...
      <ul>
        <li>Item one</li>
        <li class="special">Item two</li>
      </ul>
      ```

      This will set the style of the second item of the list as bold:

      - Item one
      - **Item two**

      MDN Web Docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/Getting_started#adding_a_class
    steps: |
      1. Add an ordered list with a top three tier list. The theme is up to you (e.g. top three favorite dishes)
      1. Use CSS classes for changing the font color of the 1st, 2nd and 3th item to `gold`, `silver` and `#cd7f32`.
    challenge: |
      Without changing the class of the first item, change its style to be bold.
    rubric:
      1st item color: 1
      2nd item color: 1
      3rd item color: 1
      Meaningful list: 1

  - name: The box model
    introduction: |
      All HTML elements can be considered _boxes_. Each box has five modifiable CSS properties:

        - `height` and `width` describes the dimensions of the content.
        - `padding` describes the space between the content and the border of the box (makes the element bigger or smaller).
        - `border` is any kind of line surrounding the box.
        - `margin` is the space around the border (separation with other elements).


      ![box model image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model/box-model.png)

      For example:

      ```html
      <style>
        p {
          padding: 5px;
          margin: 5px;
          border: 1px solid green;
        }
      </style>
      ```

      This will give a padding, margin and border to all the paragraphs of the document. You can see the result [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/play?id=%2FivztiVBOVFpYzgU8WMzw9gwEU70qGHCyNGfbCzTZPJy76%2FmzGqmBkp9JXtnSETT0EIwkoTF5QgDENEU).

    steps: |
      1. Use CSS for changing the `padding` **and** `border` of the paragraph (`p` tag) of the template. The border color and size must be different from the given example.
      1. Add one image (`img` tag) from [Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/). Use an absolute URL for the image source (`src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/..."`), don't download the image.
      1. Use CSS for changing the `width` **or** the `height` of the image.
    challenge: |
      Add a `margin` to both the paragraph and the image using a single CSS class.
    rubric:
      Paragraph padding: 1
      Paragraph border: 1
      Image width or height: 2
